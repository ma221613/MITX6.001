'''
COUNTING VOWELS  (10 points possible)
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s.
Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. For example,
if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print:
Number of vowels: 5
For problems such as these, do not include raw_input statements 
or define the variable s in any way. Our automating testing will provide 
a value of s for you - so the code you submit in the following box should 
assume s is already defined. If you are confused by this instruction, please 
review L4 Problems 10 and 11 before you begin this problem set.
