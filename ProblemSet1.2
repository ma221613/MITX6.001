Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in s. 
For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print
Number of times bob occurs is: 2
For problems such as these, do not include raw_input statements or define 
the variable s in any way. Our automating testing will provide a value of 
s for you - so the code you submit in the following box should assume s is 
already defined. If you are confused by this instruction, please review L4 
Problems 10 and 11 before you begin this problem set.

#substring = "bob"
#count=s.count(substring)
#print("Number of times bob occurs is:", count)     
   
s="bobbybobsledbob"
#b=0 
#for i in range(len(s)):
 #   if s[i:i+4] == "bob":
 #       b=b+1
        
#print ("Number of times bob occurs is:")

#print (b)

#----

substring="bob"
bob_count=0
sub_len=len(substring)

for i in range( len(s)):
    if s[i:i+sub_len] == substring:
        bob_count=bob_count+1
    
        print("Number of times bob occurs is:")
        print(bob_count)
    
#Other Answer:
    #s = 'azcbobobegghakl'

#count = 0
#x = 0
#y = 1
#z = 2
#while (z < len(s)):
 #   if s[x] == 'b' and s[y] == 'o' and s[z] == 'b':
  #      count += 1
   # x += 1
    #y += 1
    #z += 1
#print("Number of times bob occurs is:" + str(count))
